title: "#2 3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix üöÄ"
categories: LeetCode Programming
---


When working with arrays of integers, you may encounter the task of finding the **length of the longest common prefix** between all pairs of integers, one from each array. In this post, we'll explore both a **brute-force approach** and a more **optimized solution** to solve this problem efficiently.

## üìã Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of positive integers, `arr1` and `arr2`. A **prefix** of a number is a number formed by one or more of its digits starting from the leftmost digit. For example, 123 is a prefix of 12345, but 234 is not.

Your goal is to find the **length of the longest common prefix** between all pairs of integers `(x, y)` such that `x` belongs to `arr1` and `y` belongs to `arr2`.

### üí° Example 1:
```text
Input: arr1 = [1, 10, 100], arr2 = [1000]
Output: 3

Explanation: 
- The longest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.
- The longest common prefix of (10, 1000) is 10.
- The longest common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.
Thus, the longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.
```

### üí° Example 2:
```text
Input: arr1 = [1, 2, 3], arr2 = [4, 4, 4]
Output: 0

Explanation: There is no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), so the result is 0.
```

## üê¢ Brute-Force Solution

The **brute-force approach** compares each number in `arr1` with each number in `arr2` to find the common prefix between them. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Convert Numbers to Strings**: Convert each number in `arr1` and `arr2` to a string, as comparing prefixes of digits is easier when treated as strings.
2. **Compare Every Pair**: For each pair `(x, y)` from `arr1` and `arr2`, compare the corresponding characters of their string representations.
3. **Track Maximum Length**: Keep track of the longest common prefix found across all pairs.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Brute-Force Code Implementation

```python
def longest_common_prefix_length(arr1, arr2):
    # Function to calculate common prefix length between two strings
    def common_prefix_length(str1, str2):
        length = 0
        for c1, c2 in zip(str1, str2):
            if c1 == c2:
                length += 1
            else:
                break
        return length

    max_len = 0  # Track the maximum common prefix length
    for x in arr1:
        for y in arr2:
            # Convert both numbers to strings and compare
            max_len = max(max_len, common_prefix_length(str(x), str(y)))

    return max_len

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 10, 100]
arr2 = [1000]
print(longest_common_prefix_length(arr1, arr2))  # Output: 3
```

### üï∞Ô∏è Time Complexity of Brute-Force:
- **O(n * m * k)** where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2`, and `k` is the length of the longest number (in terms of digits).
- This approach compares every pair, making it inefficient for large inputs.

## ‚ö° Optimized Solution: Sorting and Two-Pointer Technique

The brute-force approach can be optimized by leveraging **sorting** and the **two-pointer technique**. The idea is that once the arrays are sorted (as strings), numbers with common prefixes will be placed close to each other. We can then compare numbers more efficiently.

### üí° Optimized Approach:
1. **Sort the Arrays**: Convert numbers to strings and sort `arr1` and `arr2` lexicographically.
2. **Use Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to compare the numbers from the sorted arrays and find the longest common prefix.

### üîç Steps:
- Sort both `arr1` and `arr2` as strings.
- Use two pointers to scan through both arrays, comparing the closest numbers after sorting.

### üöÄ Optimized Code Implementation

```python
def longest_common_prefix_length_optimized(arr1, arr2):
    # Function to calculate common prefix length between two strings
    def common_prefix_length(str1, str2):
        length = 0
        for c1, c2 in zip(str1, str2):
            if c1 == c2:
                length += 1
            else:
                break
        return length

    # Convert numbers to strings and sort them
    arr1_str = sorted(map(str, arr1))
    arr2_str = sorted(map(str, arr2))
    
    max_len = 0  # Track the maximum common prefix length
    i, j = 0, 0  # Two pointers for arr1 and arr2
    
    # Compare the closest numbers between the sorted arrays
    while i < len(arr1_str) and j < len(arr2_str):
        # Find the common prefix length between arr1_str[i] and arr2_str[j]
        max_len = max(max_len, common_prefix_length(arr1_str[i], arr2_str[j]))
        
        # Move the pointer that has the smaller number
        if arr1_str[i] < arr2_str[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    return max_len

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 10, 100]
arr2 = [1000]
print(longest_common_prefix_length_optimized(arr1, arr2))  # Output: 3
```

### ‚è≥ Time Complexity of Optimized Solution:
- **O(n log n + m log m)** for sorting both arrays, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2`.
- **O(n + m)** for the two-pointer scan.
- Overall time complexity: **O(n log n + m log m)**, which is significantly faster than the brute-force approach.

## üìù Conclusion

### üê¢ Brute-Force Solution:
- Simple but inefficient, with time complexity **O(n * m * k)**.
- Works for small inputs but becomes slow for large arrays.

### ‚ö° Optimized Solution (Sorting + Two-Pointer):
- Time complexity **O(n log n + m log m)**.
- This approach efficiently reduces unnecessary comparisons by leveraging sorting and the two-pointer technique.

When working with large datasets, the optimized solution is preferable, as it drastically reduces the time complexity compared to the brute-force solution. The key idea here is that sorting brings numbers with similar prefixes closer together, making it easier to find the longest common prefix.
