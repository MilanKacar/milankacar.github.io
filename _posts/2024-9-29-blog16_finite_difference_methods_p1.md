### 🔍 **Why the Black-Scholes Equation?**

The **Black-Scholes Equation** is a cornerstone in modern financial theory, providing a systematic way to price European-style options. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in the early 1970s, it transformed the landscape of financial markets by introducing a framework for option pricing based on stochastic calculus.

#### 📚 **Significance of Black-Scholes**

1. **Foundation of Financial Engineering:**
   - The model laid the groundwork for derivatives pricing, risk management, and hedging strategies.
   
2. **Risk-Neutral Valuation:**
   - Introduces the concept of risk-neutral pricing, simplifying the valuation by assuming investors are indifferent to risk.

3. **Hedging Portfolios:**
   - Provides a method to construct hedging portfolios that eliminate risk, essential for traders and financial institutions.

4. **Benchmark for Advanced Models:**
   - Serves as a baseline against which more complex models (e.g., stochastic volatility models) are compared.

### 🧮 **The Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation**

For a **European call option**, the Black-Scholes PDE is expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - r V = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ V(S, t) $$ = Price of the option as a function of stock price $$ S $$ and time $$ t $$
- $$ \sigma $$ = Volatility of the underlying stock
- $$ r $$ = Risk-free interest rate
- $$ t $$ = Time to maturity

#### 📖 **Derivation Highlights**

1. **Itô's Lemma:**
   - Utilized to model the dynamics of the option price $$ V $$ based on the stochastic process of the underlying asset $$ S $$.

2. **No-Arbitrage Assumption:**
   - Ensures the existence of a risk-free hedging portfolio, leading to the formulation of the PDE.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - **At Maturity ($$ t = T $$):** $$ V(S, T) = \max(S - K, 0) $$ for a call option.
   - **As $$ S \to 0 $$:** $$ V(S, t) \to 0 $$.
   - **As $$ S \to \infty $$:** $$ V(S, t) \approx S - K e^{-r(T-t)} $$.

### 💡 **Why Finite Difference Methods?**

While the Black-Scholes model offers an analytical solution for European options, real-world scenarios often involve complexities that make analytical solutions infeasible:
- **American Options:** Can be exercised anytime before expiration, introducing a free boundary problem.
- **Exotic Options:** Feature path-dependency or multiple underlying assets.
- **Variable Volatility:** Volatility may change with time or asset price.

**Finite Difference Methods (FDM)** provide a **numerical approach** to solve the Black-Scholes PDE under these complex conditions by discretizing the continuous problem into a grid of manageable points.

### 🔧 **Finite Difference Methods Applied to Black-Scholes**

Among various finite difference schemes, the **Crank-Nicolson Method** is favored in finance for its stability and accuracy. It is a combination of the explicit and implicit methods, offering a balanced approach to solving the PDE.

#### 📐 **Discretizing the Black-Scholes Equation**

1. **Grid Setup:**
   - **Stock Price Grid ($$ S $$):** Divide the stock price range $$ [0, S_{\text{max}}] $$ into $$ M $$ steps with size $$ \Delta S $$.
   - **Time Grid ($$ t $$):** Divide the time interval $$ [0, T] $$ into $$ N $$ steps with size $$ \Delta t $$.

2. **Finite Difference Approximations:**
   - **First Derivative ($$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} $$):**
     $$
     \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \approx \frac{V_{i+1,j} - V_{i-1,j}}{2\Delta S}
     $$
   - **Second Derivative ($$ \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} $$):**
     $$
     \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \approx \frac{V_{i+1,j} - 2V_{i,j} + V_{i-1,j}}{(\Delta S)^2}
     $$
   - **Time Derivative ($$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} $$):**
     $$
     \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} \approx \frac{V_{i,j+1} - V_{i,j}}{\Delta t}
     $$

3. **Crank-Nicolson Scheme:**
   - Averages the explicit and implicit methods, leading to a more stable and accurate solution:
     $$
     \frac{V_{i,j+1} - V_{i,j}}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \text{Explicit Terms} + \text{Implicit Terms} \right]
     $$

#### 📈 **Stability and Convergence**

- **Stability Condition:**
  Ensures that the numerical solution does not diverge. The Crank-Nicolson method is unconditionally stable for linear problems like Black-Scholes.

- **Convergence:**
  As $$ \Delta S $$ and $$ \Delta t $$ approach zero, the numerical solution converges to the exact solution of the PDE.

### 🐍 **Python Example: Pricing a European Call Option with FDM**

Let's implement the **Crank-Nicolson Method** to price a **European call option** on **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** stock. We'll walk through the steps with enhanced mathematical insights.

#### 🔢 **Step 1: Define Parameters and Initialize the Grid**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Option Parameters
S0 = 150        # Current stock price
K = 160         # Strike price
T = 0.5         # Time to maturity (6 months)
r = 0.05        # Risk-free interest rate
sigma = 0.2     # Volatility

# Finite Difference Parameters
S_max = 300     # Maximum stock price considered
M = 100         # Number of stock price steps
N = 1000        # Number of time steps
Delta_S = S_max / M
Delta_t = T / N

# Grid Initialization
V = np.zeros((M+1, N+1))
S = np.linspace(0, S_max, M+1)

# Boundary Conditions at Maturity
V[:, -1] = np.maximum(S - K, 0)  # European Call Payoff

# Boundary Conditions for all time steps
for j in range(N+1):
    t = j * Delta_t
    V[0, j] = 0  # Option value at S=0
    V[M, j] = S_max - K * np.exp(-r * (T - t))  # Option value at S_max
```

#### 🛠️ **Step 2: Apply the Crank-Nicolson Finite Difference Method**

```python
# Coefficients for the tridiagonal matrix
alpha = 0.25 * Delta_t * (sigma**2 * (np.arange(1, M))**2 - r * np.arange(1, M))
beta = -Delta_t * 0.5 * (sigma**2 * (np.arange(1, M))**2 + r)
gamma = 0.25 * Delta_t * (sigma**2 * (np.arange(1, M))**2 + r * np.arange(1, M))

# Initialize matrices
A = np.zeros((M-1, M-1))
B = np.zeros((M-1, M-1))

# Fill matrix A (left-hand side)
for i in range(M-1):
    A[i, i] = 1 - beta[i]
    if i > 0:
        A[i, i-1] = -alpha[i]
    if i < M-2:
        A[i, i+1] = -gamma[i]

# Fill matrix B (right-hand side)
for i in range(M-1):
    B[i, i] = 1 + beta[i]
    if i > 0:
        B[i, i-1] = alpha[i]
    if i < M-2:
        B[i, i+1] = gamma[i]

# Iterate backwards in time
for j in reversed(range(N)):
    # Right-hand side vector
    rhs = B @ V[1:M, j+1]
    
    # Solve the linear system A * V_new = rhs
    V_new = np.linalg.solve(A, rhs)
    
    # Update the option values
    V[1:M, j] = V_new
```

#### 💵 **Step 3: Extract and Visualize the Option Price**

```python
# Interpolate the option price at S0
option_price = np.interp(S0, S, V[:, 0])
print(f"The price of the European call option is: ${option_price:.2f}")

# Plot the option price against stock price at time 0
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(S, V[:,0], label='Option Price at t=0')
plt.xlabel('Stock Price ($)')
plt.ylabel('Option Price ($)')
plt.title('European Call Option Price vs. Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

**🔍 Interpretation:**

- **Option Price Extraction:**
  The interpolated option price at $$ S_0 = \$150 $$ provides the estimated value of the European call option based on the Crank-Nicolson FDM.

- **Visualization:**
  The plot showcases how the option price varies with different stock prices at the initial time ($$ t = 0 $$), offering insights into the option's sensitivity to the underlying asset's price.

This plot demonstrates the relationship between the **European call option price** and the **stock price** at \( t = 0 \), or the present time.

#### 🔍 **Key Observations:**

1. **Low Stock Prices (< $100):** 
   - The option price is close to zero. This is expected since the option is **out of the money** in this region. When the stock price is far below the strike price, it doesn’t make sense to exercise the option, so the price remains low.
   
2. **Mid-range Stock Prices ($100 - $200):**
   - The option price increases sharply here. This region represents where the option is **moving into the money**, meaning the stock price is approaching the strike price, making the call option profitable to exercise.

3. **High Stock Prices ($200 - $250):**
   - We reach the peak option price in this area. The stock price is now well above the strike price, and the call option provides the most profit potential here.

4. **Beyond $250:** 
   - Surprisingly, we observe a sudden **decline** in the option price followed by a sharp spike near $300. This is likely a result of numerical artifacts from the finite difference method, possibly due to how the **boundary conditions** were set up in the calculation. 🛠️

#### ⚠️ **What Might Cause the Behavior Beyond $250?**
   - **Numerical Instabilities:** This sudden behavior at large stock prices could be a result of boundary conditions or grid resolution issues. In theory, as the stock price rises, the option price should level out or continue increasing slowly. The spike at the far right suggests that the boundary condition isn't behaving as expected.
   
#### 🔧 **Next Steps:**
   - To smooth out this behavior at large stock prices, we might need to **refine the grid** or adjust the **boundary conditions**. This will ensure that the model behaves more naturally as the stock price increases indefinitely.
